## 📐 Critical Formulas

### 1. Penman-Monteith Equation

$$
ET_0 = \frac{0.408\Delta(R_n - G) + \gamma\frac{900}{T+273}u_2(e_s - e_a)}{\Delta + \gamma(1 + 0.34u_2)}
$$

**Most important formula for ET₀!**

---

### 2. Crop Evapotranspiration

$$
ET_c = K_c \times ET_0
$$

---

### 3. Net Irrigation Requirement

$$
IR_{net} = ET_c - P_e - GW - S
$$

---

### 4. Gross Irrigation Requirement

$$
IR_{gross} = \frac{IR_{net}}{E_a}
$$

---

### 5. Application Efficiency

$$
E_a = \frac{W_s}{W_d} \times 100
$$

---

### 6. Kennedy's Equation

$$
V_0 = 0.55 \times m \times D^{0.64}
$$

---

### 7. Lacey's Silt Factor

$$
f = 1.76\sqrt{d_{mm}}
$$

---

### 8. Lacey's Velocity

$$
V = \left[\frac{Q \times f^2}{140}\right]^{1/6}
$$

---

### 9. Manning's Equation

$$
V = \frac{1}{n} \times R^{2/3} \times S^{1/2}
$$

---

### 10. Pump Power

$$
P = \frac{\gamma \times Q \times H}{\eta}
$$

## 📊 Important Constants & Values

### Crop Coefficients (Kc)

| Crop Stage | Kc Range |
|------------|----------|
| **Initial** | 0.3-0.5 |
| **Development** | 0.5-0.8 |
| **Mid-season** | 0.8-1.2 |
| **Late season** | 0.6-0.9 |

**Typical crops:**
- Rice: Kc = 1.05-1.20 (peak)
- Wheat: Kc = 1.05-1.15
- Cotton: Kc = 1.05-1.20
- Sugarcane: Kc = 1.00-1.25

---

### Pan Coefficient (Kp)

**Typical range:** 0.70-0.85

$$
ET_0 = K_p \times E_{pan}
$$

---

### Manning's Roughness (n)

| Surface | n Value |
|---------|---------|
| Concrete lined | 0.012-0.015 |
| Brick/stone masonry | 0.015-0.020 |
| Earthen (good condition) | 0.020-0.025 |
| Earthen (poor condition) | 0.025-0.035 |

---

### Irrigation Efficiencies

| Type | Efficiency (%) |
|------|----------------|
| **Surface irrigation** | 40-60% |
| **Sprinkler** | 65-85% |
| **Drip** | 85-95% |
