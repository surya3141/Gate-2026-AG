## 🎯 Introduction

### What is Farm Power?

Farm power is the energy required to operate farm machinery and equipment for various agricultural operations.

### Importance

**Why farm power matters:**
- Increases productivity (5-10× compared to manual)
- Reduces drudgery
- Enables timely operations
- Improves crop yields
- Reduces cost of production per unit

---

### Units of Power

**Power = Rate of doing work**

$$
P = \frac{W}{t} = \frac{F \times d}{t} = F \times v
$$

**Common Units:**
- **Watt (W):** SI unit, 1 W = 1 J/s
- **Kilowatt (kW):** 1 kW = 1000 W
- **Horsepower (HP):** 1 HP = 0.746 kW = 745.7 W
- **Metric HP (PS):** 1 PS = 0.735 kW

**Conversions:**
$$
1 \text{ HP} = 0.746 \text{ kW} = 746 \text{ W} = 735.5 \text{ W (metric)}
$$

$$
1 \text{ kW} = 1.34 \text{ HP} = 1.36 \text{ PS}
$$

**Memory Trick:** **"3/4 kW per HP"** (0.746 ≈ 0.75)

$$
\text{Power (HP/ha)} = \frac{\text{Total HP from all sources}}{\text{Cultivated area (ha)}}
$$

**India average:** ~2 HP/ha (2020)
**Developed countries:** >5 HP/ha

**Components:**
- Tractors: ~1.5 HP/ha
- Power tillers: ~0.2 HP/ha
- Combines/harvesters: ~0.1 HP/ha
- Electric: ~0.2 HP/ha

---

## 🧮 Important Calculations

### Power Calculation

**From force and velocity:**
$$
P = F \times v
$$

Where:
- P = Power (W)
- F = Force (N)
- v = Velocity (m/s)

**Example:**
Draft force = 2000 N, Speed = 1.5 m/s
$$
P = 2000 \times 1.5 = 3000 \text{ W} = 3 \text{ kW} = 4 \text{ HP}
$$

---

### Human Power Output

**From work done:**
$$
P = \frac{W}{t} = \frac{m \times g \times h}{t}
$$

**Example:**
Person lifts 20 kg to 1.5 m height in 2 seconds
$$
P = \frac{20 \times 9.81 \times 1.5}{2} = \frac{294.3}{2} = 147 \text{ W} = 0.2 \text{ HP}
$$

---

### Animal Draft Power

**Draft force = % of body weight**

Typical: 10-15% of body weight

**Power:**
$$
P = \text{Draft} \times \text{Speed}
$$

**Example:**
Bullock: 400 kg, Speed: 2.5 km/h = 0.694 m/s
Draft = 12% of weight = 48 kg = 480 N
$$
P = 480 \times 0.694 = 333 \text{ W} = 0.45 \text{ HP}
$$

---

### Energy Equivalents

**1 liter diesel ≈ 10 kWh of energy**

For engine with 30% efficiency:
$$
\text{Useful work} = 10 \times 0.30 = 3 \text{ kWh}
$$

**Biogas equivalent:**
$$
1 \text{ m}^3 \text{ biogas} ≈ 0.6 \text{ L diesel}
$$
