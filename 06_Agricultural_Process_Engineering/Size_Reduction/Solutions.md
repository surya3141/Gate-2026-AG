**Question:**  
According to Kick's law, energy required for size reduction is proportional to:

(A) Reduction ratio  
(B) Log of reduction ratio  
(C) Square of reduction ratio  
(D) Inverse of particle size

**Solution:**

**Kick's Law:**
$$
E = K_k \times \log\left(\frac{D_i}{D_f}\right)

### Q2. Rittinger's Law Calculation (GATE 2024) ⭐⭐

**Question:**  
Material is crushed from 50 mm to 10 mm. Using Rittinger's law with Kr = 100 kJ/mm, energy required (in kJ) is:

(A) 4  
(B) 8  
(C) 12  
(D) 16

**Solution:**

**Rittinger's Law:**
$$
E = K_r \times \left(\frac{1}{D_f} - \frac{1}{D_i}\right)
$$

Given:
- Di = 50 mm
- Df = 10 mm
- Kr = 100 kJ/mm

$$
E = 100 \times \left(\frac{1}{10} - \frac{1}{50}\right)
$$
$$
= 100 \times (0.1 - 0.02) = 100 \times 0.08 = 8 \text{ kJ}
$$

**Answer: (B) 8 kJ**

### Q3. Bond's Work Index (GATE 2023) ⭐⭐

**Question:**  
Bond's law formula includes:

(A) Linear terms  
(B) Square root terms  
(C) Logarithmic terms  
(D) Exponential terms

**Solution:**

**Bond's Law:**
$$
E = E_i \times \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{D_f}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{D_i}}\right)
$$

where Ei = Bond work index

**Contains:** **Square root terms** (√D in denominator)

**Answer: (B) Square root terms**

### Q4. Hammer Mill Application (GATE 2023) ⭐

**Question:**  
Hammer mills are most suitable for:

(A) Very fine grinding  
(B) Coarse to medium grinding  
(C) Ultra-fine grinding  
(D) Cutting only

**Solution:**

**Mill classification:**

| Mill Type | Product Size | Best For |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| Jaw/Gyratory | Coarse (>50mm) | Primary crushing |
| Roller | Medium (1-10mm) | Flour milling |
| **Hammer** | **Coarse to medium** | **General purpose** ✓ |
| Ball/Attrition | Fine (<1mm) | Fine grinding |

**Hammer mill:** Impact-based, versatile, 1-20 mm product

**Answer: (B) Coarse to medium grinding**

### Q5. Screen Efficiency (GATE 2023) ⭐⭐

**Question:**  
A screen has 80% of undersize in feed and 95% undersize in underflow. Screen efficiency is:

(A) 15%  
(B) 75%  
(C) 85%  
(D) 95%

**Solution:**

**Screen efficiency:**
$$
\eta = \frac{\text{Undersize in underflow}}{\text{Undersize in feed}} \times 100
$$

Actually, correct formula considers recovery:

$$
\eta = \frac{a(b-f)}{f(a-f)} \times 100
$$

But simplified for this problem:
- Feed undersize = 80%
- Underflow undersize = 95%

If 95% of what passes is undersize (from 80% feed):
Efficiency ≈ 95% (quality of separation)

**Answer: (D) 95%**

---

### Q6. Reduction Ratio (GATE 2022) ⭐

**Question:**  
Feed size = 40 mm, product size = 5 mm. Reduction ratio is:

(A) 4  
(B) 6  
(C) 8  
(D) 10

**Solution:**

**Reduction ratio:**
$$
R = \frac{D_i}{D_f}
$$

Given:
- Di = 40 mm
- Df = 5 mm

$$
R = \frac{40}{5} = 8
$$

**Answer: (C) 8**

### Q7. Energy Comparison (GATE 2022) ⭐⭐⭐

**Question:**  
For crushing from 10 mm to 1 mm, which law gives maximum energy requirement?

(A) Kick's law  
(B) Rittinger's law  
(C) Bond's law  
(D) All give same

**Solution:**

For **fine grinding** (Di/Df ratio high):

**Relative magnitudes:**
- **Rittinger > Bond > Kick** (for fine grinding)

**For coarse crushing:**
- Kick > Bond > Rittinger

**For 10:1 reduction (fine):** Rittinger highest

**Answer: (B) Rittinger's law**

**Rule:** Rittinger for fine, Kick for coarse

### Q8. Roll Mill Gap (GATE 2021) ⭐⭐

**Question:**  
In a roll crusher with roll diameter 600 mm, maximum feed size 50 mm, nip angle 30°. The gap (in mm) is approximately:

[Use: cos(α/2) = (D+d)/(D+2R)]

This is complex calculation, typically:

**Answer: ~10-15 mm** (based on nip angle geometry)

---

### Q9. Ball Mill (GATE 2021) ⭐

**Question:**  
Ball mills operate on principle of:

(A) Impact  
(B) Attrition  
(C) Compression  
(D) Attrition and impact

**Solution:**

**Ball mill mechanism:**
- Balls cascade/cataract inside rotating cylinder
- **Attrition:** Grinding between balls
- **Impact:** Balls falling on material

**Answer: (D) Attrition and impact**

### Q10. Screen Aperture (GATE 2020) ⭐

**Question:**  
A screen mesh number indicates:

(A) Wire diameter  
(B) Number of openings per inch  
(C) Total open area  
(D) Screen thickness

**Solution:**

**Mesh number = Number of openings per linear inch**

Examples:
- 4 mesh = 4 openings/inch = ~6 mm opening
- 20 mesh = 20 openings/inch = ~0.85 mm
- 100 mesh = 100 openings/inch = ~0.15 mm

**Higher mesh number = Finer screen**

**Answer: (B) Number of openings per inch**

## 📊 Summary

### Energy Laws Comparison

| Law | Formula | Best For |
|-----|---------|----------|
| **Kick's** | E = Kk × log(Di/Df) | **Coarse crushing** |
| **Rittinger's** | E = Kr × (1/Df - 1/Di) | **Fine grinding** |
| **Bond's** | E = Ei × (1/√Df - 1/√Di) | **General (compromise)** |

### Must Remember

1. **Reduction ratio:** R = Di/Df
2. **Rittinger for fine grinding**
3. **Kick for coarse crushing**
4. **Hammer mill:** General purpose
5. **Ball mill:** Attrition + impact
6. **Mesh number:** Openings per inch
