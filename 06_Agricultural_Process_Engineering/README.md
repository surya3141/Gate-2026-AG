## 📐 Critical Formulas

### 1. Moisture Content Conversion

**Wet basis to dry basis:**
$$
M_{db} = \frac{M_{wb}}{100 - M_{wb}} \times 100
$$

**Dry basis to wet basis:**
$$
M_{wb} = \frac{M_{db}}{100 + M_{db}} \times 100
$$

---

### 2. Drying Rate

$$
\frac{dM}{dt} = K \times (M - M_e)
$$

---

### 3. Kick's Law

$$
E = K_k \times \log\left(\frac{D_i}{D_f}\right)
$$

---

### 4. Rittinger's Law

$$
E = K_r \times \left(\frac{1}{D_f} - \frac{1}{D_i}\right)
$$

---

### 5. Bond's Law

$$
E = E_i \times \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{D_f}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{D_i}}\right)
$$

---

### 6. Janssen's Equation

$$
P_v = \frac{\gamma \times R}{k \times \mu} \times \left[1 - e^{-k\mu h/R}\right]
$$

$$
P_h = k \times P_v
$$

---

### 7. Conveyor Capacity

$$
Q = 3.6 \times A \times v \times \rho
$$
