## 📈 Preparation Strategy

### Time Allocation (Per Week)

**Quantitative:** 3-4 hours
- Practice 20-30 problems
- Focus on speed and accuracy
- Use shortcuts and tricks

**Verbal:** 2-3 hours
- Read newspapers/articles daily
- Practice grammar exercises
- Build vocabulary (10-15 words/day)

### Practice Approach

**1. Build Foundation (Week 1-2):**
- Learn basic formulas and concepts
- Understand grammar rules
- Practice simple problems

**2. Speed Building (Week 3-4):**
- Solve previous year questions
- Time yourself (1.5 min per mark)
- Identify weak areas

**3. Mock Tests (Week 5-6):**
- Full GA section mock tests
- Analyze mistakes
- Focus on accuracy over speed

### Exam Strategy

**Time Management:**
- **Target:** 22-25 minutes for 15 marks
- **1-mark questions:** 45-60 seconds each
- **2-mark questions:** 90-120 seconds each

**Attempt Strategy:**
1. **Quick scan** (30 sec): Identify easy questions
2. **Solve easy first** (10 min): Secure 8-10 marks
3. **Medium difficulty** (10 min): Attempt carefully
4. **Difficult/time-consuming:** Skip or guess strategically
5. **Review** (2-3 min): Check silly mistakes

**Guessing Strategy:**
- **1-mark:** Negative -1/3 (guess if 50%+ sure)
- **2-mark:** Negative -2/3 (guess only if 60%+ sure)
- Don't leave blank if you can eliminate 2+ options

## 🎯 Key Formulas & Concepts

### Quantitative Essentials

**Percentages:**
```
Percentage increase = (Increase/Original) × 100
Percentage decrease = (Decrease/Original) × 100
x% of y = (x/100) × y
```

**Time-Work:**
```
Work = Rate × Time
If A completes in 'a' days, work done per day = 1/a
Combined work: 1/A + 1/B = 1/T (T = total time together)
```

**Time-Distance:**
```
Speed = Distance/Time
Average speed = 2xy/(x+y) for equal distances at speeds x, y
Relative speed: Same direction (x-y), Opposite (x+y)
```

**Profit-Loss:**
```
Profit% = (Profit/CP) × 100
Loss% = (Loss/CP) × 100
SP = CP × (100 ± Profit/Loss%)/100
```

**Geometry:**
```
Triangle area = (1/2) × base × height = √[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)]
Circle area = πr², Circumference = 2πr
Sphere volume = (4/3)πr³, Surface area = 4πr²
Cylinder volume = πr²h, Surface area = 2πr(r+h)
```

### Verbal Essentials

**Subject-Verb Agreement:**
- Singular subject → Singular verb
- Plural subject → Plural verb
- Collective nouns usually singular

**Tenses:**
- **Simple present:** Regular actions
- **Present continuous:** Ongoing actions
- **Present perfect:** Completed actions with present relevance
- **Past perfect:** Action completed before another past action

**Common Errors:**
- Between/Among (2 vs 3+)
- Less/Fewer (uncountable vs countable)
- Each/Every (singular verb)
