## 🔥 Essential Formulas (MUST MEMORIZE)

### Percentages
```
x% increase then x% decrease → Net = -x²/100 (always loss!)

Example: 20% up, 20% down = -(20²/100) = -4%

Percentage = (Part/Whole) × 100
Increase% = (Increase/Original) × 100
Decrease% = (Decrease/Original) × 100
```

### Time and Work
```
Work = Rate × Time

If A does in 'a' days → 1 day work = 1/a

Combined: 1/A + 1/B = 1/T

Example: A=12 days, B=18 days
Combined = 1/12 + 1/18 = 5/36 → Together = 36/5 = 7.2 days
```

### Speed-Distance-Time
```
Speed = Distance / Time

Equal distances at speeds x, y:
Average speed = 2xy/(x+y)  [Harmonic mean]

Relative speed:
- Same direction: |x - y|
- Opposite direction: x + y
```

### Profit and Loss
```
Profit% = (Profit/CP) × 100
Loss% = (Loss/CP) × 100

SP = CP × (100 + Profit%) / 100
CP = (SP × 100) / (100 + Profit%)

Marked Price with discount:
SP = MP × (100 - Discount%) / 100
```

### Simple Interest
```
SI = (P × R × T) / 100

Amount = P + SI = P(1 + RT/100)

If amount doubles in T years → R = 100/T %
If amount triples in T years → R = 200/T %
```

### Compound Interest
```
A = P(1 + R/100)^T

CI = A - P

For half-yearly: A = P(1 + R/200)^(2T)
For quarterly: A = P(1 + R/400)^(4T)
```

### Ratio and Proportion
```
If a:b = c:d → ad = bc (cross multiplication)

If x:y = a:b and y:z = c:d
Make middle term equal, then x:z = (a×c):(b×d)

Quick: x/z = (x/y) × (y/z)
```

### Mixtures (Alligation)
```
      Cheaper          (Mean - Cheaper)
           ╲           ╱
            ╲         ╱
             Mean
            ╱         ╲
           ╱           ╲
      Costlier       (Costlier - Mean)

Ratio = Cross differences
```

### Geometry - Triangle
```
Area = (1/2) × base × height

Heron's formula:
A = √[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)]
where s = (a+b+c)/2

Pythagoras: a² + b² = c² (right triangle)
```

### Geometry - Circle
```
Area = πr²
Circumference = 2πr

Sector area = (θ/360) × πr²
Arc length = (θ/360) × 2πr
```

### Geometry - 3D Shapes
```
Cube:
Volume = a³, Surface area = 6a²

Cuboid:
Volume = l × b × h
Surface area = 2(lb + bh + hl)

Cylinder:
Volume = πr²h
Curved surface = 2πrh
Total surface = 2πr(r + h)

Sphere:
Volume = (4/3)πr³
Surface area = 4πr²
```

### Series
```
AP (Arithmetic):
nth term: aₙ = a + (n-1)d
Sum: Sₙ = (n/2)[2a + (n-1)d]
     or Sₙ = (n/2)(first + last)

GP (Geometric):
nth term: aₙ = ar^(n-1)
Sum: Sₙ = a(r^n - 1)/(r - 1)  [r>1]
     or Sₙ = a(1 - r^n)/(1 - r)  [r<1]
```

### Number System
```
LCM × HCF = Product of two numbers

Even × Even = Even
Odd × Odd = Odd
Even × Odd = Even

Sum of first n natural numbers = n(n+1)/2
Sum of first n squares = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6
```

## 💡 Memory Tricks

### 1. "% Up-Down = Loss x²/100"
20% increase then 20% decrease = **-4% loss**
- Always net loss (never gain!)
- Formula: -x²/100

### 2. "Equal Distance = Harmonic Mean"
Average speed for **equal distances** = 2xy/(x+y)
- NOT arithmetic mean (x+y)/2
- Example: 50 km/h, 75 km/h → 60 km/h (not 62.5)

### 3. "Double Money SI = 100/T"
If money doubles in T years at SI:
- R = 100/T %
- Example: Doubles in 10 years → R = 10%

### 4. "Work Add Reciprocals"
A does in 12 days, B in 18 days
- Together: 1/12 + 1/18 = 5/36
- Time = 36/5 = 7.2 days

### 5. "LCM × HCF = Product"
If LCM = 48, HCF = 8, one number = 16
- Other = (48 × 8) / 16 = 24

### 6. "Heron Needs Semi-Perimeter"
s = (a+b+c)/2 first
Then A = √[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)]

### 7. "π ≈ 3.14 or 22/7"
Use 22/7 for fractions
Use 3.14 for decimals

## 🎯 Quick Calculation Techniques

### Percentage Shortcuts
```
10% → Divide by 10
20% → Divide by 5
25% → Divide by 4
33.33% → Divide by 3
50% → Divide by 2
75% → 3/4
```

### Multiplication Tricks
```
11 × any 2-digit: 23 × 11 = 2(2+3)3 = 253
25 × any: Multiply by 100, divide by 4
125 × any: Multiply by 1000, divide by 8
```

### Square Shortcuts
```
(a+b)² = a² + 2ab + b²
(a-b)² = a² - 2ab + b²

Example: 52² = (50+2)² = 2500 + 200 + 4 = 2704
```

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Average speed confusion
❌ **Wrong:** (50+75)/2 = 62.5 km/h for equal distances
✅ **Correct:** 2×50×75/(50+75) = **60 km/h**

### Mistake 2: % increase-decrease
❌ **Wrong:** 20% up, 20% down = no change
✅ **Correct:** Net = **-4% loss** (formula: -x²/100)

### Mistake 3: SI doubling
❌ **Wrong:** Doubles in 10 years → R = 20%
✅ **Correct:** R = **100/10 = 10%**

### Mistake 4: Time-work addition
❌ **Wrong:** 12 + 18 = 30 days together
✅ **Correct:** 1/12 + 1/18 = 5/36 → **7.2 days**

### Mistake 5: Unit errors
❌ **Wrong:** Mixing km/h with m/s without conversion
✅ **Correct:** Always check units (km/h × 5/18 = m/s)

## 🎯 Exam Strategy

### Time Allocation (15 marks = 22 min)
```
1-mark question: 45-60 seconds
2-mark question: 90-120 seconds

Strategy:
1. Scan all 10 questions (30 sec)
2. Easy questions first (10 min) → 8-10 marks
3. Medium difficulty (8 min) → 2-4 marks
4. Guess/skip difficult (2 min)
5. Review (2 min)
```

### Priority Order
```
1. Direct formula questions (%, SI, ratio)
2. Simple calculations (geometry, series)
3. Word problems (time-work, speed)
4. Complex data interpretation
5. Skip if >2 min
```

### Guessing Strategy
```
1-mark: Guess if eliminate 2 options (negative -1/3)
2-mark: Guess only if 60%+ sure (negative -2/3)

Elimination tips:
- Check unit mismatch
- Obviously too high/low
- Use approximation
```
