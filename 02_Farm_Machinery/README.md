## 🔑 Essential Formulas

### Field Capacity
$$
\text{TFC (ha/h)} = \frac{W \times S}{10}
$$

$$
\text{EFC} = \text{TFC} \times \eta_f
$$

### Power & Draft
$$
P_{\text{db}} (\text{kW}) = \frac{D \times V}{3.6}
$$

### Rotavator
$$
\lambda = \frac{\pi D N}{60 V}
$$

### Plant Population
$$
P = \frac{10000}{R \times S}
$$

### Quality Index
$$
Q = 100 - (M + D)
$$
