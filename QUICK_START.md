## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake 1: Reading Everything Linearly
Don't try to read every file from start to finish. Jump to topics you need.

### ❌ Mistake 2: Skipping PYQs
Theory alone won't help. Must practice actual questions.

### ❌ Mistake 3: Not Making Personal Notes
This repository is reference. Make your own summary notes.

### ❌ Mistake 4: Forgetting Revision
New learning without revision = waste of time.

### ❌ Mistake 5: Not Testing Yourself
Regularly attempt mock tests using PYQs.
